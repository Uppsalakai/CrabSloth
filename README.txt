KavajuchanLazerEyes(tm), code name "CrabSloth". A web based software for displaying Cosplayers during a show.
The presentation software was created by UppCon and Agigen.

This web application should be run in Chrome or Firefox in Presentation Mode and uses a virtual green screen (with specifiable chroma key) for your
image mixing software / hardware.

This is provided as is and were written during an evening before UppCon, use at own risk. :)

----

Due to OS X failure in having a good Full screen support, you will need to run OS X Mountain Lion (to have separate windows fullscreened on separate displays) or a Windows installation with Chrome.

You may also use Firefox, since it seems like it isn't all that fscked up. Even though fonts won't look as good. :(

The shell-script in img/cosplays and img/references should be run at OS X or Linux. You need ImageMagick installed on your machine to run the script.
The script per-se is not required, but could be a nice to have if you wish you remove your chroma key color from the images shown and replace it with an adjacent pixelcolor.


Peace. Tack f√∂r att ni kom.
